# Dlsys course hw

Just to help me finish my homeworks between devices and places until this readme uploaded.

Good course, know deeper not only about deep learning system, but also operation implementation, autograd, deep learning compilation and so on.

I finished hw0 - hw3 completely (total 100 points for each of them), and got 70 points for hw4, didn't submit LSTM and LaunguageModel (just too busy)

Enjoy it.
